    "\n",
    "The client for this project is the Bank of England. Here is an excerpt from the project briefing, profiling the Bank:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Bank of England's mission is to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability. The Bank of England plays a multifaceted role in the national economy. Its primary objectives include maintaining price stability and supporting the government’s economic policies. To achieve this, the Bank has control over monetary policy instruments, primarily the setting of interest rates. By altering interest rates, the Bank can influence borrowing costs for businesses and individuals, which in turn affects spending, investment, and inflation. \n",
    "\n",
    "More information about the Bank of England can be found [here.](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario for this project, as outlined in the briefing, is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "> Part of the job of the Bank of England is to provide reassurance and stability to financial markets. One way this is achieved is through representatives of the Bank delivering speeches at various public events. As an organisation, the Bank of England is interested in how the trends in these speeches correlate with observed events and economic indicators, as well as how the sentiment of these speeches can be used to predict market behaviour. This analysis will inform our understanding of the impact of the Bank’s communications on the economy, as well as the predictive power of using this data set."

    "    * publication of the Monetary Policy Report\n",
